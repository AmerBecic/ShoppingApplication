# Shopping App
This is a demo for a Shopping app. 


Having accumulated 2 years of experience with the MVC design pattern, I've chosen to embark on a challenging journey to explore and construct something using the MVVM architecture in .Net Framework. <br/>

**At the moment application is getting upgraded to use .Net Core**.

Looking ahead, I intend to also further develop this application using the MVC.

## Description

Again this is a demo, with MVP bulding style. Main focus is on the functionalities of backend part of the application. <br/>
I do have plans to improve Frontend part of the application, but probably not in a near future.

This application allows you to buy Products from Inventory. <br/>
Currently here are 3 types of users (Admin, Cashier and Manager).

Technologies used:

- .Net MVVM (in future MVC)
- Dapper and EF
- SQL
- Git
- Bootstrap

Currently only UI part of the app has Dependency Injection built into it. <br/>
Future plan is to implement Dependency Injection system into API.
